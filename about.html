				 <p>Water is an essential part of the human diet, and as such, its quality is of crucial importance to Flint residents especially during this Water Crisis. The quality of water affects not only its usage but also its long-term storage and the cost of its purification. Testing and purification of water are activities that have largely been relegated to huge private and public and private laboratory complexes. This has meant for a greater population of Flint, the testing and purification services have been rendered inaccessible or simply too costly to incur. The implications of this inaccessibility has been tremendous health costs for various users around Flint area due to consumption of polluted and contaminated water. With an ongoing water crisis within the Flint society, the need for portable, effective and efficient purification strategies have been tripled. It is upon this background that the Faucet Water Analyzer was developed. </p>

				  <p>The conceptualization of the Faucet Water Analyzer came from the need to have an affordable and easily accessible water analysis tool that would guarantee simplicity of use for the average user as well the most effective usability within its environment of application. The gadget promises the easiest and most convenient operation ability, maintenance and on-site usability. The Faucet Water Analyzers comes along with a downloadable mobile application, which offers the report on the real-time analysis of the water. The Faucet renders not only the service of showing the water pollution level, Total dissolved solids but also the total amount of water used as well as and how much filter left to be change. Combined with the mobile app that comes with the Faucet, the user is assured of of real time monitoring of their water to ensure safety for all the users. </p>
